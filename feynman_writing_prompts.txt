Objects - A type of class that holds a combination of variables, functions, and other types of data structures to manipulate data. Think of it as a data container.

i.e. 
var person = {
    firstName:"John",
    lastName:"Doe",
    age:50,
    eyeColor:"blue"
};

=================================
Properties -  an atrribute of an object that defines something about an object (size, color, etc.). Basically, they are values for that object. Think of it as a special variable on object

i.e. in the example above firstName is a property of the person object.


==================================
Methods - A procedure associated with an object. A method is an action that an object can perform, such as a function.

i.e. 
console.log
console is the object and log is a method of this object that does something (output).

===================================
for in loop - A type of loop that iterates over the properties of an object.


==================================
Dot notation vs bracket notation - Two types of ways to manipulate (such as add or return) properties to objects. Dot notation should always be used unless the property name is unknown.

i.e.

users.username is dot notation
users['username'] is bracket notation
